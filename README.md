# School District Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the overall impact on school district statistics as a result of adjusted math and reading scores for Thomas High School. Specifcally, math and reading scores from 461 ninth grade students were removed from the analysis as the academic integrity of those scores came under question.

## Results

* The results of the revised analysis indicate that the overall figures in the district analysis were essentially unchanged with the removal of the ninth grade students.

* The elimination of the ninth grade scores for Thomas High school dramatically impacted the percentage passing math, percentage passing reading, and overall passing percentage for the school, with those percentages increasing for each category. Prior to the removal of the students, Thomas High School had a passing math percentage of 66.9%, a passing reading percentage of 69.7%, and an overall passing percentage across both subjects of 65.1%. Following the removal of the scores, the Thomas High School passing math percentage increased to 93.2%, the passing reading percentage increased to 97.0%, and the overall passing percentage across both subjects increased to 90.6%. These statistics are more in line with figures seen from other charter type schools.
