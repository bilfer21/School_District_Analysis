# School District Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the overall impact on school district statistics as a result of adjusted math and reading scores for Thomas High School. Specifcally, math and reading scores from 461 ninth grade students were removed from the analysis as the academic integrity of those scores came under question.

## Results

* The results of the revised analysis indicate that the overall figures in the district analysis were essentially unchanged with the removal of the nith grade students.
