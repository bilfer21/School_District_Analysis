# School District Analysis

## Overview

Specifcally, math and reading scores from 461 ninth grade students were removed from the analysis as the academic integrity of those scores came under question.

## Results

* The results of the revised analysis indicate that the overall figures in the district analysis were essentially unchanged with the removal of the nith grade students.
