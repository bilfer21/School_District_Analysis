# School District Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the overall impact on school district statistics as a result of adjusted math and reading scores for Thomas High School (THS). Specifcally, math and reading scores from 461 ninth grade students were removed from the analysis as the academic integrity of those scores came under question.

## Results

* The results of the revised analysis indicate that the overall figures in the district analysis were essentially unchanged with the removal of the ninth grade students.

* The elimination of the ninth grade scores for THS dramatically impacted the percentage passing math, percentage passing reading, and overall passing percentage for the school, with those percentages increasing for each category. Prior to the removal of the students, THS had a passing math percentage of 66.9%, a passing reading percentage of 69.7%, and an overall passing percentage across both subjects of 65.1%. Following the removal of the scores, the THS passing math percentage increased to 93.2%, the passing reading percentage increased to 97.0%, and the overall passing percentage across both subjects increased to 90.6%.

## Summary

As a result of the removal of THS ninth grade scores from the analysis, the performance of Thomas High School relative to other schools in the district rose considerably. Before the removal of the scores, Thomas ranked 8th out of 15 district schools in regards to overall passing percentage across both math and reading. With the scores removed, THS now ranks 2nd in the district in terms of overall passing percentage. As a result of the adjustments, the passing percentages for THS now are comparable to those seen in other charter schools in the district. With the student scores removed, the overall district figures for passing math and passing reading were adjusted from 75.0% and 85.8% to 74.8% and 85.7%, respectively. The overall passing percentage for both subjects across students in the district decreased from 65.2% to 64.9%
